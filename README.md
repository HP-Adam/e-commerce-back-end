# E-commerce Back End

This is the backend management for a typical e-commerce business. A number of api routes have been created that, when implemented to a front end, would allow the access, creation, manipulation, and deleting of data. This data includes the catagories that products can fall into, the products themselves, and the tags associated with them that would be used if a user was searching for products on a broad spectrum.
